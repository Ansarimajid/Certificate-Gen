# Django Certificate Generator

Welcome to the Django Certificate Generator, an open-source project built using the powerful Django web framework. This application is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, allowing users to create certificates that match their style. It also provides functionality to generate certificates in bulk and send them via email. This README file provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and other relevant information.

## Features
